# [Public] Software Engineer / Architect - Partner Integration

**Global Wellness Retreats** specializes in organizing personalized wellness retreats in various locations around the world. These retreats focus on health, relaxation, and rejuvenation, catering to individuals seeking a wellness-focused getaway. GWR collaborates with wellness experts, local resorts, and travel agencies to create bespoke packages for clients.

## **Use Case for API:**

**Objective**: To enhance the personalization of each retreat, GWR needs detailed information about their clients, including their travel preferences and origin countries. This information helps in customizing the retreat experience to suit individual cultural backgrounds and wellness goals.

**Need for API**:

- GWR partners with various travel agencies and wellness platforms that refer clients to them.
- These partners need to securely transmit client data, including email, country of origin, and travel dates, to GWR.
- This data is crucial for GWR to include in their CRM to customize the retreat experience (i.e send them a personalized email ahead of their trip)

## **Test Case: Build a Secure API Endpoint in NodeJS**

**Objective:** Develop a small NodeJS application (you can use the framework of your choice) with an API endpoint to process client data for Global Wellness Retreats.
